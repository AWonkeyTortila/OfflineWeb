# What is OfflineWeb?
Offline Web is basically the internet, but all downloaded locally on to your machine. A more complex intranet, if you will.

# How do I open the main page?

go to where you download it, open the folder, then open "client", then open "Main.html"

# Why does OfflineWeb exist?
It exist simply as a way for you to explore the intranet but without needing to be online, which basically makes it one of the most securest ways to browse the internet. Wow, and all by accident too.

# How do I contribute code?
Look at the documentation. (So download, go to the hompage, and then go to the documentation.)

# How do I download this?
Click on tags, and then click on the latest one. Please don't download the code directly off the main branch, that's asking for a buggy build, and a distater.
