I want a wife to be honest. (I am a dude btw)

I might get married once I graduate HS or Collage. I kinda wish I didnt mess
things up with Akayla. We were close, and I messed it up.
I hate bad mental health. Luckily I am better now. But there is not much point
to it now since the one person who motivated me is now gone.
